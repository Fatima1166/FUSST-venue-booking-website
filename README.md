The FUSST Venue Booking System is a web-based application designed to modernize and simplify the venue reservation process at FUSST. It offers an intuitive interface for users to register, log in, and browse available venues with detailed information. With features like venue listings, booking requests based on real-time availability, and admin controls for managing bookings, users, and venue data, the system ensures a transparent and efficient process. It leverages an SQL-integrated database for robust data management and automates administrative tasks to avoid conflicts in reservations, providing a seamless, streamlined experience. The running process involves users visiting the portal, registering or logging in, selecting their desired venue, and submitting a booking request, while admins manage and update booking statuses through the backend. The system’s aesthetic embraces a sophisticated theme of deep blue, sand, light blue, and gold accents, with white boxes creating a striking contrast, crafting a visually engaging and refined experience that underscores the system’s modern functionality and elegance.
